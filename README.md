Aim:- C++ Program to Make a Simple Calculator.

Theory:- A simple calculator program in C++ demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as variables, operators, and control flow. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result. Basic error handling is implemented to manage cases like division by zero and invalid operation inputs. This straightforward approach introduces essential programming practices such as user input handling, decision-making using control structures, and output display.
